  Its an NCERT syllabus based question and solution creation task.
  Grades are from 3 - 8 
  ### Inputs (Provided by User)
    - Subject / Course / Grade: {{Subject}}
    - Grade Level: {{Grade}}
    - Chapter Number & Name: {{Chapter}}
      {{TOPICS_SECTION}}
    - IMPORTANT → Total Questions to Generate: {{TOTAL_QUESTIONS}}
    - Old Concepts: {{Old_Concept}}  # Prerequisite knowledge - what the student has already studied before this chapter
    
    - (if the topic requires to use the pdf) The attached PDF contains the key concepts of the chapter.
    - The purpose of analyzing key_concepts is solely to ensure the questions remain:
      - grade-appropriate,
      - aligned with what the student has already learned,
      - and correctly situated within the chapter's conceptual progression.
    - Treat the uploaded PDF as a **closed syllabus boundary**.
    - Do **NOT** infer, assume, or import concepts from outside the PDF.
    - Do **NOT** use results that are traditionally associated with the topic but not covered in the PDF.
    - Infer to the pdf and understand what the student has already learned and what the student should know from the pdf.
    - The idea and concept used in the questions should be from the pdf. 
    ## PDF 
      If a pdf is uploaded then analyse the full pdf to understand the topics and subtopics(for each topic you can generate questions by using the concept used in that topic). So understand those so that you can genrate variety of questions if needed.
    ## PDF Topic Boundary Rules [important rule if pdf is there]

      Analyze the entire PDF and identify clear boundaries between topics and subtopics. When the user specifies a subtopic, locate the precise boundary for that subtopic and use only the concepts, definitions, methods,
      and exercise patterns contained within that boundary. Do not mix or leak concepts from earlier or later topics. Do not introduce ideas from other sections unless the exercises of that subtopic explicitly require them.
      Study how the exercises for that subtopic/topic are built to understand the style of questioning and the concept being tested. Do not copy or rephrase those exercises. Instead, generate new, concept-aligned questions modeled on the same idea. 
      The user will always give a topic/subtopic; use only that subtopic’s/topic's boundary to make the questions.Never address the pdf as textbook, pdf or any other thing in the questions
      
      ## STRICT KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARY RULES
          Treat the uploaded PDFs/images as the only source of knowledge. Do not use any outside syllabus, curriculum, or textbook knowledge. Do not introduce concepts, terminology, skills, or grade-level content that is not explicitly shown in the uploaded material. If the material shows addition, subtraction, even/odd numbers, halving, or true/false reasoning, generate new items only using those same concepts. Do not name properties, laws, or theories unless they are explicitly printed in the PDF/image.
          Generate new/duplicate questions that match the original item structure, same difficulty level, and same style. Do not increase the grade level or add any new concepts. Do not assume hidden mathematical knowledge. Do not infer properties (example: do not mention commutativity unless the PDF/image names it). Do not introduce higher grade concepts.
          The uploaded content defines a closed knowledge boundary. If a concept, method, property, term, or instruction is not present in the PDF/image, do not include it in the generated items. Stay fully faithful to the language, style, tasks, operations, and reasoning patterns present in the PDF/image.
      # PDF Magnitude rule 
          Strictly adhere to the number range and magnitude specified in the pdf or concepts provided, ensuring that all numerical values, unit conversions, 
          and intermediate calculations remain within the scope of numbers introduced in the chapter. Do not introduce larger units, extended conversions, 
          or numbers that exceed the expected level of rigor

      All distractors must be plausible, curriculum-aligned, and should effectively test conceptual understanding without violating the prescribed numeric range.
    ## MULTI-TOPIC HANDLING:
      - You are generating questions for {{NUMBER_OF_TOPICS}} topic(s).
      - Process each topic independently.
      - Ensure clear separation of questions by topic.
      - Follow the exact number of questions specified for each topic.

    ALL mcq questions must remain strictly within the science domain implied by the Topic and Chapter.
    DO NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself explicitly integrates them.
    - Based on the domain selection you need to make questions 

  **Each mcq question must fall entirely within ONE science domain based on the Topic and Chapter.  
  Do NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself is inherently interdisciplinary.**

  === SCIENCE TAXONOMY RULE (MANDATORY) ===

    Each question MUST strictly follow the given Taxonomy. 
    The main task verb and scientific reasoning demand must match the taxonomy below.
    If a mismatch is found, STOP and return an error.

    Allowed Taxonomies (exact strings only):
    Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Evaluating

    1) Remembering (Science)
    - Purpose: Recall scientific facts or definitions
    - Allowed verbs: define, state, name, list, identify, label, recognise
    - Not allowed: explain, compare, justify, judge

    - The question verb MUST belong to the allowed list of its taxonomy.
    - The solution MUST use the same cognitive level.
    - If Topic verb and Taxonomy conflict, return:
      "ERROR: Topic verb conflicts with declared Science Taxonomy. Revise input."

  ## TOPIC COVERAGE AND TRACEABILITY (MANDATORY)

  1. Coverage Rule (MANDATORY)
     - You MUST generate questions for EVERY topic mentioned.
     - Do NOT skip, merge, or partially cover any topic.
     - If a topic requires N questions, generate exactly N questions.

  2. Topic Traceability Rule
     - Above EACH question, explicitly mention:
       Topic Used: <exact topic name>
     - The topic name must exactly match one of the input topics.

  3. Question Generation Rule
     - Each question must strictly follow the given:
       - Marks
       - DOK level
     - Do NOT change or average these values across topics.
     - Each question should be independent unless explicitly stated otherwise.


  Scientific Concept Targeting:
    Ensure that the modified item preserves or strengthens conceptual relevance. The scientific idea or principle being assessed (e.g., conservation of mass, photosynthesis, Newton’s laws, chemical reactions, energy transfer, adaptation, etc.) must be explicit, required, and central to the reasoning. Avoid items where the scenario is realistic but the science demand becomes superficial or recall-only; such items are considered weak in conceptual relevance.

  4. Initial Planning Section (REQUIRED)
     Before generating questions, create a clear plan in this format:

     Planned Topics and Question Allocation:
     - Topic 1: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     - Topic 2: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     (Include ALL topics provided by the user.)

  5. Final Verification Section (REQUIRED)
     After generating all questions, add a final section titled:

     "Topic Coverage Verification"

     In this section:
     - List ALL topics provided by the user.
     - For each topic, explicitly state:
       - Number of questions generated
       - Confirmation that the requirement is fulfilled

     Example format:
     - Topic: ______ → Generated: __ / Required: __ → Status: COMPLETE

  - **Note**: Concepts consist of New Concepts (current chapter content) and Old Concepts (prerequisite knowledge). Prioritize new concepts for questions.
  - The purpose of analyzing concepts is solely to ensure the questions remain:
    - grade-appropriate,
    - aligned with what the student has already learned,
    - and correctly situated within the chapter's conceptual progression.

  - Do NOT create questions mixing prerequisite topics not listed in the specified topics.  
    Key concepts guide background understanding, but topics generate the actual content.
  - Everything including the question as well as the solution should be under the topic and should only use the method which is taught in that topic(For example, students in lower grades use different methods to solve problems than students in higher grades. Their approach depends on the concepts taught at that grade level. So, check the relevant concept to understand the method that students of that grade are expected to use.For making question as well as answers ).

    - Ensure all **scientific content is accurate**, with logically sound explanations and correct conclusions.
    - Each question must be **distinct**, and must not resemble previously generated items.
    - Align every question with the specified **DOK level** and **cognitive taxonomy**.
    - Ensure the difficulty, language, and structure are **appropriate for the target grade**.
    - Use only the scientific ideas and concepts listed in the specified topics.
    - Design questions that assess **conceptual scientific understanding**, including causal reasoning, mechanisms, and relationships — not just recall of isolated facts.


  ## Question Uniqueness — Topic-Locked, Expression-Creative

    - All questions must be built strictly from the scientific concepts inside the specified topics.
      No new mechanisms, no off-syllabus phenomena, no unrelated scientific ideas, and no external assumptions.

    - Uniqueness must NOT come from introducing new concepts.
      Instead, uniqueness must come from:
          • presenting different observational setups
          • framing scenarios under different environmental or experimental conditions
          • contrasting two observations or cases in a non-standard way
          • requiring causal, comparative, predictive, or inferential reasoning within the same concept space
          • using tables, diagrams, or evidence in uncommon (but valid) forms

      Think of this as exploring alternative reasoning paths **within** the same scientific boundaries,
      without stepping outside the original concept space.

    - Avoid stereotypical textbook wordings or standard exam tropes
      (e.g., avoid the overly common “What gas is released during photosynthesis?” style).
      Use scientifically correct framing that is still fresh, realistic, or inquiry-based.

    - Despite using unique framings, the scientific language, terminology, and depictions must remain
      academically correct and age-appropriate.

    - Do not include explicit hints about the scientific principle or relationship needed to answer.
      Avoid phrasing that tells the student what law, mechanism, or model to apply
      (e.g., “Using Newton’s Third Law, determine…” or “Apply the particle model…”).



  ## STRICT TOPIC ADHERENCE
    - You will be given a list of topics with a specific number of questions for each.
    - For each question, strictly use ONLY the concepts from the ONE specific topic assigned to that question.
    - Do NOT mix concepts from different topics within a single question.
    - All parts of the question (Scenario, Sub-questions a, b, c, etc.) must belong to that SAME single topic.
    - Do NOT use concepts from "Topic B" when generating a question for "Topic A", even if both are in the input list.
    - Treat each topic's request as a completely isolated task.
 
  ### MCQ Structure Requirements

  Each MCQ must have:

  1. **Question**: A clear, well-formulated question that tests the specified concept
     - Use student-friendly language appropriate for {{Grade}}
     - Names should be simple and commonly used  (eg : Jack	Anna  Ryan	Emily	Sam	Maria	John	Maya	Anand	)
     - Avoid ambiguous wording
     - Include all necessary information
     - Use correct mathematical notation

  2. **Four Answer Choices**: Exactly 4 options labeled A, B, C, D
     - **1 Correct Answer**: The only correct solution
     - **3 Distractors**: Plausible but incorrect options

  3. **Solution**: Step-by-step solution showing how to arrive at the correct answer
     - Clearly explain the reasoning
     - Show all steps
     - Justify why the correct answer is right

  4. **Distractor Analysis**: For each of the 3 distractors, explain:
     - Why a student might choose this incorrect option
     - What misconception or error leads to this answer
     - How to correct the misunderstanding
     - It should be maximum of 4 lines 
     - It shouldnt contain the correct option in the distractor analysis
  
    ### Mandatory Distractor Analysis Format
    Use the structure below without altering the narrative flow:

    "You have identified that Statement ___ is true.  
    But you missed to identify that Statement ___ is also a true statement.  
    You might have thought so since ___ (error type).  
    Also, you thought that Statement ___ is a correct statement since ___ (specific reason)."

    ### Output Constraints
    - Do NOT use vague language.
    - Do NOT skip mentioning:
      - a missed true statement (if applicable), and
      - a wrongly selected false statement.
    - Each incorrect option must have its **own complete distractor analysis**.

   ## TEXTBOOK CONTENT HANDLING (CRITICAL)
    - **Do NOT treat the textbook/concept excerpts as reading passages in questions**
    - **Do NOT reference the textbook/concept material as a passage**
    - Questions must be self-contained and NEVER reference the source material directly
    All generated questions and solutions must be fully standalone and must NOT reference textbook pages, chapters, passages, or excerpts. Do NOT treat the textbook content as a passage to be quoted or cited.

    **FORBIDDEN question/Answer patterns:**
    - ❌ "According to the textbook..."
    - ❌ "According to the definition provided in the chapter..."
    - ❌ "The story on page 13 mentions..."
    - ❌ "The definition on page X specifically states..."
    - ❌ "Based on the passage/story/definition provided..."
    - ❌ "As described in the concept/chapter..."
    
    **Correct approach:**
    - ✅ Extract the mathematical concept and create an independent question
    - ✅ Questions should stand alone without referencing the source
    - ✅ Use the concepts to generate original problem scenarios
    - ✅ Never make students refer back to textbook pages or definitions
    
    - Do NOT convert textbook/concept text into long descriptive paragraphs in your questions as well as answers .
    - Use only the necessary elements from the content to construct the question.
    - This is exam-ready content - you cannot reference external materials
    - Avoid comprehension-type question framing.

  ## Representation and Method Discipline

  All generated questions, options, solutions, reasoning steps, and distractor analyses must strictly conform to the representations, terminology, units, symbols, processes, models, and conceptual framing used in the provided textbook/PDF for that topic and grade.

  Rules:
  1. Do not introduce any terminology, unit, model, law, mechanism, or representation that is not present in the textbook/PDF.
  2. If the textbook uses specific representations (e.g., “food chain” instead of “trophic pathway”, “mass” instead of “weight”, “light ray diagram” instead of formulaic description), you must use the same representation consistently.
  3. If the textbook omits a representation or construct (e.g., chemical equations, rate formulas, vector notation, advanced measurement precision, detailed anatomical labels), do not introduce it.
  4. Do not increase abstraction level (e.g., do not convert descriptive processes into quantitative equations or scientific laws unless the textbook explicitly teaches them).
  5. Do not use any explanatory model, data interpretation method, or scientific reasoning step that students at this grade have not been taught according to the textbook/PDF.
  6. During validation, flag and repair any violation of these rules automatically without altering the structural format of the question type.
  7. Textbook/PDF takes priority over general NCERT content. Use NCERT-level knowledge only if it aligns naturally and does not introduce new constructs.
  8. If a representation, model, or construct is missing in the textbook/PDF, treat it as prohibited.

  Enforcement:
  - These rules apply to the question, solution, distractor analysis, and key idea.
  - Any violation must be corrected before final output.
  - Even when content is limited to a single topic, you MUST generate variety through:
      • different observational contexts
      • different environmental or experimental conditions
      • different forms of evidence
      • different causal or comparative reasoning paths
  - The solution for all questions must follow the **specific explanatory model or method** explicitly emphasized in the chapter (e.g., starch test for photosynthesis, food chain diagrams for ecosystem flow, ray diagram interpretation for reflection, apparatus diagrams for experiments).
  - If the chapter introduces or emphasizes a particular technique or representation (e.g., using tables for data, ray diagrams for light, or labeled diagrams for plant structures), then **every relevant question in that chapter** must use the same technique consistently, including in simpler sub-questions.
  - The explanation and reasoning must be grade-appropriate.
  - This ensures consistency with what the student is currently being taught at that grade level.
  - Only if no specific method is mentioned in the chapter should a general grade-appropriate explanation be used.
  - **Do not** upgrade to higher-grade scientific models (e.g., chemical equations, reaction mechanisms, molecular models, Newtonian equations, density/force/velocity formulas) unless explicitly introduced in the chapter.

  ## DIAGRAM RULES
    - A diagram is optional (unless its mentioned).
    - If included, provide a **diagram prompt** (NOT the final image).
    - If the topic inherently requires visual/structural representation (e.g., circuits, anatomy, ray diagrams, apparatus setups, ecological scenes), then the diagram becomes mandatory, and questions in that topic must be diagram-based with all information tied to the visual stimulus.

      ### Diagram Prompt Guidelines:

      **Purpose:**  
      Create exam-ready scientific visuals that support the question by conveying structure, relationships, evidence, or spatial/experimental setups.

      **Content Requirements:**
      - The prompt must describe a scene or setup, not simply list isolated objects.
      - It must be suitable for inclusion in a school science exam.
      - It should depict the relevant phenomenon, structure, apparatus, environment, organism, or system with appropriate scientific labeling.
      - Include essential details such as labels, components, directions, magnitudes, or observable features when relevant to the concept.
      - Use realistic scientific data or conditions if needed (e.g., light positions, plant parts, circuit components, environmental factors, comparative specimens).
      - Keep visuals simple, consistent, and self-contained; avoid decorative or narrative clutter.
      - The diagram must reinforce the same context as the written question by presenting the structural or observational aspect of the setup.

      **Format Requirements:**
      - Do NOT use point-by-point bullet lists.
      - Use continuous descriptive narrative that clearly defines the layout, components, and relationships.
      - The prompt must read as a cohesive depiction, not a disjointed list of objects.

      ### Data/Label Placement Rules:
      - **Diagram Prompt:**  
        Introduce labels, visual identifiers, directions, comparative indicators, or data values that the student must interpret.

      ### No-Repetition Rule:
      - Information mentioned in the written context must NOT be duplicated in the diagram.
      - Each section must serve a distinct purpose:
          • **Short Context** → qualitative, environmental, biological, or experimental narrative  
          • **Diagram** → spatial, structural, observational, or data-based representation of the same setup


    ## LANGUAGE AND DIFFICULTY RULES (CRITICAL)
      ### Age-Appropriate Wording:
      - **ALL question wordings must be age-appropriate for {{Grade}}**
      - Use simple, clear, and student-friendly language that matches the grade level
      - Avoid unnecessarily complex vocabulary or confusing sentence structures
      - Questions should be easy to read and understand at first glance
      
      ### Difficulty Through Problem-Solving, NOT Vocabulary:
      - **NEVER use difficult or advanced wording to artificially increase difficulty level**
      - The difficulty level (DOK 1, 2, or 3) must come from:
          ✔ The internal mathematical complexity
          ✔ The number of reasoning steps required
          ✔ The cognitive demand of the problem-solving process
          ✘ NOT from complex vocabulary or confusing language
      
      - A DOK 3 question should be challenging because of its **reasoning requirements**, not because students struggle to understand what is being asked
      - Students should understand the question clearly; the challenge should be in solving it
      
      ### Language Clarity:
      - Use direct, straightforward phrasing
      - Avoid ambiguous or unnecessarily formal language
      - Ensure question intent is crystal clear to the student
      - Technical mathematical terms are acceptable ONLY if they are part of the {{Grade}} curriculum

    ## GRADE-APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS
      ## Solution Complexity:
      - Solutions must match the child's grade level
      - Do NOT use advanced terminology or methods beyond the grade level
      - Do NOT include derivations or formulas not taught at that grade
      - Avoid explanations that are too abstract for the grade 
      
      ## Explanation Length:
      - Keep solution steps **short and clear**
      - Each step should be concise and to the point
      - Avoid unnecessarily verbose explanations
      - Focus on the essential reasoning, not exhaustive detail
      
      ## Age-Appropriate Language:
      - Use simple, child-friendly language appropriate for {{Grade}}
      - Avoid complex mathematical jargon unless it's part of the curriculum
      - Ensure explanations are accessible to students at that grade level

  ---
  ## TAXONOMY LOCK RULE (MANDATORY)

  **Taxonomy Lock Rule**
   - For every question type, the user will explicitly specify:
     - Taxonomy (e.g., Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, etc.)
     - DOK level
     - Marks
   - You MUST use **only the taxonomy provided for that question type**.
   - Do NOT substitute, infer, upgrade, downgrade, or mix taxonomies.
   - If a question cannot be generated under the given taxonomy, you must still stay within it and simplify the question accordingly.

  **One-to-One Mapping**
    - Each generated question must map **directly** to:
      - The taxonomy mentioned for that specific question type
      - The DOK level mentioned for that specific question type
    - Do not reuse taxonomy from other question types.

  **Output Consistency Check (Mandatory)**
      - Before finalizing output, internally verify:
        - Taxonomy in the output exactly matches the taxonomy stated in the input for that question.
        - No question contains cognitive operations beyond the allowed taxonomy.
          - Example:
            - "Analyze", "justify", "compare", "prove" → NOT allowed in Remembering
            - "Recall", "state", "identify" → NOT sufficient for Analyzing
      - If mismatch is detected, regenerate the question.

  **Explicit Display Rule**
      - Above each question, clearly display(the question and the this part should be seperated with a line (DONT ADD FOR SUBQUESTIONS, IT SHOULD BE ABOVE EACH QUESTION ) ):
        - Topic
        - MCQ Type (if specified)
        - Marks
        - DOK Level
        - Taxonomy (must match input verbatim)
        - Validation for different type of error classification

  **No Cross-Contamination**
      - Do NOT let:
        - Higher-order taxonomy leak into lower-order questions
        - Solution explanations exceed the allowed cognitive level

  **Failure Handling**
      - If user input is ambiguous or internally inconsistent:
        - State the limitation clearly
        - Do NOT guess or auto-correct taxonomy

  **Final Validation Statement**
      - After generating all questions, include a final checklist stating:
        - Which taxonomies were requested
        - Which taxonomies were used
        - Confirm they match exactly

  **OUTPUT FORMAT: The distractor analysis MUST be presented as a markdown table with two columns: "Option" and "Misconception"**. The “Option” column must display the option label followed by the assigned error type.

    For each incorrect option (3 distractors), follow this exact explanation structure:

  **Option [X]: [The incorrect answer]**

  **Why students might select this:**
  - Begin by identifying the likely mistake: "You selected this option because you likely…"
  - Explain the specific error or misconception that leads to this answer
  - Be specific about what went wrong (e.g., "used addition instead of multiplication", "confused the formula", "forgot to convert units")

  **What's wrong with this approach:**
  - Explain clearly why this reasoning is incorrect
  - Show the correct concept or procedure that should have been used
  - Use mathematical reasoning to demonstrate the error

  **Correct approach:
  - Briefly state what the student should have done instead
  - Connect back to the correct answer
  - Do not explicitly use headings or labels such as "Why the Student Chose It", "Correct the Misunderstanding", or "Final Clarification". Each distractor explanation must be written as one continuous paragraph that implicitly includes: (i) the reasoning or misconception that could lead a student to select the option, (ii) an explanation of why that reasoning is incorrect, and (iii) a brief statement of the correct idea or approach. All three elements must appear in this order within the same paragraph.

      **Important Rules:**
      - Do NOT partially praise the student unless it matches the option's meaning.  
      - Keep the explanation simple, student-friendly, detailed, and grammatically correct.
      - Use equations or symbols when needed.
      - Maintain a smooth flow between sentences.


   #### Output Constraint
    - Do NOT change the tone or structure.
    - Do NOT omit either:
        - the reason for rejecting a true/valid scientific statement, or
        - the reason for selecting a false/incorrect scientific statement.
    - This format is mandatory for all statement-based distractor analyses.

    **CRITICAL Distractor Analysis Requirements:**
    - **Maximum Length**: Each distractor rationale must be **4 lines maximum** (total for all three sub-sections combined)
    - **Child-Friendly Language**: Use simple, age-appropriate language suitable for {{Grade}}
    - **Concise and Clear**: No long explanations — keep it short and focused
    - **Educational Tone**: Supportive and corrective, not condescending
    - Do NOT say things like: “You correctly identified that…” for an incorrect option
    - Use scientific terms or labels when needed, but keep them minimal and grade-appropriate
    - Do NOT explicitly say phrases such as:
        • “Why students might select this”
        • “What’s wrong with this approach”
        • “Correct approach”
      (You directly explain the reasoning behind the distractor.)
    - Each distractor rationale must be unique and highlight a different type of misunderstanding
      (e.g., confusion about cause/effect, misclassification, wrong observation, misuse of terms, mixing processes, etc.)
    - Each distractor analysis must remain within the **4-line maximum**
