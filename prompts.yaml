  Its an NCERT syllabus based question and solution creation task.
  Grades are from 3 - 8 
  ### Inputs (Provided by User)
    - Subject / Course / Grade: {{Subject}}
    - Grade Level: {{Grade}}
    - Chapter Number & Name: {{Chapter}}
      {{TOPICS_SECTION}}
    - IMPORTANT → Total Questions to Generate: {{TOTAL_QUESTIONS}}
    - Old Concepts: {{Old_Concept}}  # Prerequisite knowledge - what the student has already studied before this chapter
    
    - (if the topic requires to use the pdf) The attached PDF contains the key concepts of the chapter.
    - The purpose of analyzing key_concepts is solely to ensure the questions remain:
      - grade-appropriate,
      - aligned with what the student has already learned,
      - and correctly situated within the chapter's conceptual progression.
    - Treat the uploaded PDF as a **closed syllabus boundary**.
    - Do **NOT** infer, assume, or import concepts from outside the PDF.
    - Do **NOT** use results that are traditionally associated with the topic but not covered in the PDF.
    - Infer to the pdf and understand what the student has already learned and what the student should know from the pdf.
    - The idea and concept used in the questions should be from the pdf. 
    ## PDF 
      If a pdf is uploaded then analyse the full pdf to understand the topics and subtopics(for each topic you can generate questions by using the concept used in that topic). So understand those so that you can genrate variety of questions if needed.
    ## PDF Topic Boundary Rules [important rule if pdf is there]

      Analyze the entire PDF and identify clear boundaries between topics and subtopics. When the user specifies a subtopic, locate the precise boundary for that subtopic and use only the concepts, definitions, methods,
      and exercise patterns contained within that boundary. Do not mix or leak concepts from earlier or later topics. Do not introduce ideas from other sections unless the exercises of that subtopic explicitly require them.
      Study how the exercises for that subtopic/topic are built to understand the style of questioning and the concept being tested. Do not copy or rephrase those exercises. Instead, generate new, concept-aligned questions modeled on the same idea. 
      The user will always give a topic/subtopic; use only that subtopic’s/topic's boundary to make the questions.Never address the pdf as textbook, pdf or any other thing in the questions
      
      ## STRICT KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARY RULES
          Treat the uploaded PDFs/images as the only source of knowledge. Do not use any outside syllabus, curriculum, or textbook knowledge. Do not introduce concepts, terminology, skills, or grade-level content that is not explicitly shown in the uploaded material. If the material shows addition, subtraction, even/odd numbers, halving, or true/false reasoning, generate new items only using those same concepts. Do not name properties, laws, or theories unless they are explicitly printed in the PDF/image.
          Generate new/duplicate questions that match the original item structure, same difficulty level, and same style. Do not increase the grade level or add any new concepts. Do not assume hidden mathematical knowledge. Do not infer properties (example: do not mention commutativity unless the PDF/image names it). Do not introduce higher grade concepts.
          The uploaded content defines a closed knowledge boundary. If a concept, method, property, term, or instruction is not present in the PDF/image, do not include it in the generated items. Stay fully faithful to the language, style, tasks, operations, and reasoning patterns present in the PDF/image.
      # PDF Magnitude rule 
          Strictly adhere to the number range and magnitude specified in the pdf or concepts provided, ensuring that all numerical values, unit conversions, 
          and intermediate calculations remain within the scope of numbers introduced in the chapter. Do not introduce larger units, extended conversions, 
          or numbers that exceed the expected level of rigor

      All distractors must be plausible, curriculum-aligned, and should effectively test conceptual understanding without violating the prescribed numeric range.
    ## MULTI-TOPIC HANDLING:
      - You are generating questions for {{NUMBER_OF_TOPICS}} topic(s).
      - Process each topic independently.
      - Ensure clear separation of questions by topic.
      - Follow the exact number of questions specified for each topic.

    ALL mcq questions must remain strictly within the science domain implied by the Topic and Chapter.
    DO NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself explicitly integrates them.
    - Based on the domain selection you need to make questions 

  **Each mcq question must fall entirely within ONE science domain based on the Topic and Chapter.  
  Do NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself is inherently interdisciplinary.**

  === SCIENCE TAXONOMY RULE (MANDATORY) ===

    Each question MUST strictly follow the given Taxonomy. 
    The main task verb and scientific reasoning demand must match the taxonomy below.
    If a mismatch is found, STOP and return an error.

    Allowed Taxonomies (exact strings only):
    Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Evaluating

    1) Remembering (Science)
    - Purpose: Recall scientific facts or definitions
    - Allowed verbs: define, state, name, list, identify, label, recognise
    - Not allowed: explain, compare, justify, judge

    - The question verb MUST belong to the allowed list of its taxonomy.
    - The solution MUST use the same cognitive level.
    - If Topic verb and Taxonomy conflict, return:
      "ERROR: Topic verb conflicts with declared Science Taxonomy. Revise input."

  ## TOPIC COVERAGE AND TRACEABILITY (MANDATORY)

  1. Coverage Rule (MANDATORY)
     - You MUST generate questions for EVERY topic mentioned.
     - Do NOT skip, merge, or partially cover any topic.
     - If a topic requires N questions, generate exactly N questions.

  2. Topic Traceability Rule
     - Above EACH question, explicitly mention:
       Topic Used: <exact topic name>
     - The topic name must exactly match one of the input topics.

  3. Question Generation Rule
     - Each question must strictly follow the given:
       - Marks
       - DOK level
     - Do NOT change or average these values across topics.
     - Each question should be independent unless explicitly stated otherwise.


  Scientific Concept Targeting:
    Ensure that the modified item preserves or strengthens conceptual relevance. The scientific idea or principle being assessed (e.g., conservation of mass, photosynthesis, Newton’s laws, chemical reactions, energy transfer, adaptation, etc.) must be explicit, required, and central to the reasoning. Avoid items where the scenario is realistic but the science demand becomes superficial or recall-only; such items are considered weak in conceptual relevance.

  4. Initial Planning Section (REQUIRED)
     Before generating questions, create a clear plan in this format:

     Planned Topics and Question Allocation:
     - Topic 1: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     - Topic 2: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     (Include ALL topics provided by the user.)

  5. Final Verification Section (REQUIRED)
     After generating all questions, add a final section titled:

     "Topic Coverage Verification"

     In this section:
     - List ALL topics provided by the user.
     - For each topic, explicitly state:
       - Number of questions generated
       - Confirmation that the requirement is fulfilled

     Example format:
     - Topic: ______ → Generated: __ / Required: __ → Status: COMPLETE

  - **Note**: Concepts consist of New Concepts (current chapter content) and Old Concepts (prerequisite knowledge). Prioritize new concepts for questions.
  - The purpose of analyzing concepts is solely to ensure the questions remain:
    - grade-appropriate,
    - aligned with what the student has already learned,
    - and correctly situated within the chapter's conceptual progression.

  - Do NOT create questions mixing prerequisite topics not listed in the specified topics.  
    Key concepts guide background understanding, but topics generate the actual content.
  - Everything including the question as well as the solution should be under the topic and should only use the method which is taught in that topic(For example, students in lower grades use different methods to solve problems than students in higher grades. Their approach depends on the concepts taught at that grade level. So, check the relevant concept to understand the method that students of that grade are expected to use.For making question as well as answers ).

    - Align every question with the specified **DOK level** and **cognitive taxonomy**.
    - Ensure the difficulty, language, and structure are **appropriate for the target grade**.
    - Use only the scientific ideas and concepts listed in the specified topics.
    - Design questions that assess **conceptual scientific understanding**, including causal reasoning, mechanisms, and relationships — not just recall of isolated facts.


  ## Question Uniqueness — Topic-Locked, Expression-Creative

    - All questions must be built strictly from the scientific concepts inside the specified topics.
      No new mechanisms, no off-syllabus phenomena, no unrelated scientific ideas, and no external assumptions.

    - Uniqueness must NOT come from introducing new concepts.
      Instead, uniqueness must come from:
          • presenting different observational setups
          • framing scenarios under different environmental or experimental conditions
          • contrasting two observations or cases in a non-standard way
          • requiring causal, comparative, predictive, or inferential reasoning within the same concept space
          • using tables, diagrams, or evidence in uncommon (but valid) forms

      Think of this as exploring alternative reasoning paths **within** the same scientific boundaries,
      without stepping outside the original concept space.

    - Avoid stereotypical textbook wordings or standard exam tropes
      (e.g., avoid the overly common “What gas is released during photosynthesis?” style).
      Use scientifically correct framing that is still fresh, realistic, or inquiry-based.

    - Despite using unique framings, the scientific language, terminology, and depictions must remain
      academically correct and age-appropriate.

    - Do not include explicit hints about the scientific principle or relationship needed to answer.
      Avoid phrasing that tells the student what law, mechanism, or model to apply
      (e.g., “Using Newton’s Third Law, determine…” or “Apply the particle model…”).



  ## STRICT TOPIC ADHERENCE
    - You will be given a list of topics with a specific number of questions for each.
    - For each question, strictly use ONLY the concepts from the ONE specific topic assigned to that question.
    - Do NOT mix concepts from different topics within a single question.
    - All parts of the question (Scenario, Sub-questions a, b, c, etc.) must belong to that SAME single topic.
    - Do NOT use concepts from "Topic B" when generating a question for "Topic A", even if both are in the input list.
    - Treat each topic's request as a completely isolated task.
 
  ### MCQ Structure Requirements

  Each MCQ must have:

  1. **Question**: A clear, well-formulated question that tests the specified concept
     - Use student-friendly language appropriate for {{Grade}}
     - Names should be simple and commonly used  (eg : Jack	Anna  Ryan	Emily	Sam	Maria	John	Maya	Anand	)
     - Avoid ambiguous wording
     - Include all necessary information
     - Use correct mathematical notation

  2. **Four Answer Choices**: Exactly 4 options labeled A, B, C, D
     - **1 Correct Answer**: The only correct solution
     - **3 Distractors**: Plausible but incorrect options

  3. **Solution**: Step-by-step solution showing how to arrive at the correct answer
     - Clearly explain the reasoning
     - Show all steps
     - Justify why the correct answer is right

  4. **Distractor Analysis**: For each of the 3 distractors, explain:
     - Why a student might choose this incorrect option
     - What misconception or error leads to this answer
     - How to correct the misunderstanding
     - It should be maximum of 4 lines 
     - It shouldnt contain the correct option in the distractor analysis
  
    ### Mandatory Distractor Analysis Format
    Use the structure below without altering the narrative flow:

    "You have identified that Statement ___ is true.  
    But you missed to identify that Statement ___ is also a true statement.  
    You might have thought so since ___ (error type).  
    Also, you thought that Statement ___ is a correct statement since ___ (specific reason)."

    ### Output Constraints
    - Do NOT use vague language.
    - Do NOT skip mentioning:
      - a missed true statement (if applicable), and
      - a wrongly selected false statement.
    - Each incorrect option must have its **own complete distractor analysis**.

  ---


   ## TEXTBOOK CONTENT HANDLING (CRITICAL)
    - **Do NOT treat the textbook/concept excerpts as reading passages in questions**
    - **Do NOT reference the textbook/concept material as a passage**
    - Questions must be self-contained and NEVER reference the source material directly
    All generated questions and solutions must be fully standalone and must NOT reference textbook pages, chapters, passages, or excerpts. Do NOT treat the textbook content as a passage to be quoted or cited.

    **FORBIDDEN question/Answer patterns:**
    - ❌ "According to the textbook..."
    - ❌ "According to the definition provided in the chapter..."
    - ❌ "The story on page 13 mentions..."
    - ❌ "The definition on page X specifically states..."
    - ❌ "Based on the passage/story/definition provided..."
    - ❌ "As described in the concept/chapter..."
    
    **Correct approach:**
    - ✅ Extract the mathematical concept and create an independent question
    - ✅ Questions should stand alone without referencing the source
    - ✅ Use the concepts to generate original problem scenarios
    - ✅ Never make students refer back to textbook pages or definitions
    
    - Do NOT convert textbook/concept text into long descriptive paragraphs in your questions as well as answers .
    - Use only the necessary elements from the content to construct the question.
    - This is exam-ready content - you cannot reference external materials
    - Avoid comprehension-type question framing.

  ## Representation and Method Discipline

  All generated questions, options, solutions, reasoning steps, and distractor analyses must strictly conform to the representations, terminology, units, symbols, processes, models, and conceptual framing used in the provided textbook/PDF for that topic and grade.

  Rules:
  1. Do not introduce any terminology, unit, model, law, mechanism, or representation that is not present in the textbook/PDF.
  2. If the textbook uses specific representations (e.g., “food chain” instead of “trophic pathway”, “mass” instead of “weight”, “light ray diagram” instead of formulaic description), you must use the same representation consistently.
  3. If the textbook omits a representation or construct (e.g., chemical equations, rate formulas, vector notation, advanced measurement precision, detailed anatomical labels), do not introduce it.
  4. Do not increase abstraction level (e.g., do not convert descriptive processes into quantitative equations or scientific laws unless the textbook explicitly teaches them).
  5. Do not use any explanatory model, data interpretation method, or scientific reasoning step that students at this grade have not been taught according to the textbook/PDF.
  6. During validation, flag and repair any violation of these rules automatically without altering the structural format of the question type.
  7. Textbook/PDF takes priority over general NCERT content. Use NCERT-level knowledge only if it aligns naturally and does not introduce new constructs.
  8. If a representation, model, or construct is missing in the textbook/PDF, treat it as prohibited.

  Enforcement:
  - These rules apply to the question, solution, distractor analysis, and key idea.
  - Any violation must be corrected before final output.
  - Even when content is limited to a single topic, you MUST generate variety through:
      • different observational contexts
      • different environmental or experimental conditions
      • different forms of evidence
      • different causal or comparative reasoning paths
  - The solution for all questions must follow the **specific explanatory model or method** explicitly emphasized in the chapter (e.g., starch test for photosynthesis, food chain diagrams for ecosystem flow, ray diagram interpretation for reflection, apparatus diagrams for experiments).
  - If the chapter introduces or emphasizes a particular technique or representation (e.g., using tables for data, ray diagrams for light, or labeled diagrams for plant structures), then **every relevant question in that chapter** must use the same technique consistently, including in simpler sub-questions.
  - The explanation and reasoning must be grade-appropriate.
  - This ensures consistency with what the student is currently being taught at that grade level.
  - Only if no specific method is mentioned in the chapter should a general grade-appropriate explanation be used.
  - **Do not** upgrade to higher-grade scientific models (e.g., chemical equations, reaction mechanisms, molecular models, Newtonian equations, density/force/velocity formulas) unless explicitly introduced in the chapter.

  ## DIAGRAM RULES
    - A diagram is optional (unless its mentioned).
    - If included, provide a **diagram prompt** (NOT the final image).
    - If the topic inherently requires visual/structural representation (e.g., circuits, anatomy, ray diagrams, apparatus setups, ecological scenes), then the diagram becomes mandatory, and questions in that topic must be diagram-based with all information tied to the visual stimulus.

      ### Diagram Prompt Guidelines:

      **Purpose:**  
      Create exam-ready scientific visuals that support the question by conveying structure, relationships, evidence, or spatial/experimental setups.

      **Content Requirements:**
      - The prompt must describe a scene or setup, not simply list isolated objects.
      - It must be suitable for inclusion in a school science exam.
      - It should depict the relevant phenomenon, structure, apparatus, environment, organism, or system with appropriate scientific labeling.
      - Include essential details such as labels, components, directions, magnitudes, or observable features when relevant to the concept.
      - Use realistic scientific data or conditions if needed (e.g., light positions, plant parts, circuit components, environmental factors, comparative specimens).
      - Keep visuals simple, consistent, and self-contained; avoid decorative or narrative clutter.
      - The diagram must reinforce the same context as the written question by presenting the structural or observational aspect of the setup.

      **Format Requirements:**
      - Do NOT use point-by-point bullet lists.
      - Use continuous descriptive narrative that clearly defines the layout, components, and relationships.
      - The prompt must read as a cohesive depiction, not a disjointed list of objects.

      ### Data/Label Placement Rules:
      - **Diagram Prompt:**  
        Introduce labels, visual identifiers, directions, comparative indicators, or data values that the student must interpret.

      ### No-Repetition Rule:
      - Information mentioned in the written context must NOT be duplicated in the diagram.
      - Each section must serve a distinct purpose:
          • **Short Context** → qualitative, environmental, biological, or experimental narrative  
          • **Diagram** → spatial, structural, observational, or data-based representation of the same setup


    ## LANGUAGE AND DIFFICULTY RULES (CRITICAL)
      ### Age-Appropriate Wording:
      - **ALL question wordings must be age-appropriate for {{Grade}}**
      - Use simple, clear, and student-friendly language that matches the grade level
      - Avoid unnecessarily complex vocabulary or confusing sentence structures
      - Questions should be easy to read and understand at first glance
      
      ### Difficulty Through Problem-Solving, NOT Vocabulary:
      - **NEVER use difficult or advanced wording to artificially increase difficulty level**
      - The difficulty level (DOK 1, 2, or 3) must come from:
          ✔ The internal mathematical complexity
          ✔ The number of reasoning steps required
          ✔ The cognitive demand of the problem-solving process
          ✘ NOT from complex vocabulary or confusing language
      
      - A DOK 3 question should be challenging because of its **reasoning requirements**, not because students struggle to understand what is being asked
      - Students should understand the question clearly; the challenge should be in solving it
      
      ### Language Clarity:
      - Use direct, straightforward phrasing
      - Avoid ambiguous or unnecessarily formal language
      - Ensure question intent is crystal clear to the student
      - Technical mathematical terms are acceptable ONLY if they are part of the {{Grade}} curriculum

    ## GRADE-APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS
      ## Solution Complexity:
      - Solutions must match the child's grade level
      - Do NOT use advanced terminology or methods beyond the grade level
      - Do NOT include derivations or formulas not taught at that grade
      - Avoid explanations that are too abstract for the grade 
      
      ## Explanation Length:
      - Keep solution steps **short and clear**
      - Each step should be concise and to the point
      - Avoid unnecessarily verbose explanations
      - Focus on the essential reasoning, not exhaustive detail
      
      ## Age-Appropriate Language:
      - Use simple, child-friendly language appropriate for {{Grade}}
      - Avoid complex mathematical jargon unless it's part of the curriculum
      - Ensure explanations are accessible to students at that grade level

  ---
  ## TAXONOMY LOCK RULE (MANDATORY)

  **Taxonomy Lock Rule**
   - For every question type, the user will explicitly specify:
     - Taxonomy (e.g., Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, etc.)
     - DOK level
     - Marks
   - You MUST use **only the taxonomy provided for that question type**.
   - Do NOT substitute, infer, upgrade, downgrade, or mix taxonomies.
   - If a question cannot be generated under the given taxonomy, you must still stay within it and simplify the question accordingly.

  **One-to-One Mapping**
    - Each generated question must map **directly** to:
      - The taxonomy mentioned for that specific question type
      - The DOK level mentioned for that specific question type
    - Do not reuse taxonomy from other question types.

  **Output Consistency Check (Mandatory)**
      - Before finalizing output, internally verify:
        - Taxonomy in the output exactly matches the taxonomy stated in the input for that question.
        - No question contains cognitive operations beyond the allowed taxonomy.
          - Example:
            - "Analyze", "justify", "compare", "prove" → NOT allowed in Remembering
            - "Recall", "state", "identify" → NOT sufficient for Analyzing
      - If mismatch is detected, regenerate the question.

  **Explicit Display Rule**
      - Above each question, clearly display(the question and the this part should be seperated with a line (DONT ADD FOR SUBQUESTIONS, IT SHOULD BE ABOVE EACH QUESTION ) ):
        - Topic
        - MCQ Type (if specified)
        - Marks
        - DOK Level
        - Taxonomy (must match input verbatim)
        - Validation for different type of error classification

  **No Cross-Contamination**
      - Do NOT let:
        - Higher-order taxonomy leak into lower-order questions
        - Solution explanations exceed the allowed cognitive level

  **Failure Handling**
      - If user input is ambiguous or internally inconsistent:
        - State the limitation clearly
        - Do NOT guess or auto-correct taxonomy

  **Final Validation Statement**
      - After generating all questions, include a final checklist stating:
        - Which taxonomies were requested
        - Which taxonomies were used
        - Confirm they match exactly

  **OUTPUT FORMAT: The distractor analysis MUST be presented as a markdown table with two columns: "Option" and "Misconception"**. The “Option” column must display the option label followed by the assigned error type.

    For each incorrect option (3 distractors), follow this exact explanation structure:

  **Option [X]: [The incorrect answer]**

  **Why students might select this:**
  - Begin by identifying the likely mistake: "You selected this option because you likely…"
  - Explain the specific error or misconception that leads to this answer
  - Be specific about what went wrong (e.g., "used addition instead of multiplication", "confused the formula", "forgot to convert units")

  **What's wrong with this approach:**
  - Explain clearly why this reasoning is incorrect
  - Show the correct concept or procedure that should have been used
  - Use mathematical reasoning to demonstrate the error

  **Correct approach:
  - Briefly state what the student should have done instead
  - Connect back to the correct answer
  - Do not explicitly use headings or labels such as "Why the Student Chose It", "Correct the Misunderstanding", or "Final Clarification". Each distractor explanation must be written as one continuous paragraph that implicitly includes: (i) the reasoning or misconception that could lead a student to select the option, (ii) an explanation of why that reasoning is incorrect, and (iii) a brief statement of the correct idea or approach. All three elements must appear in this order within the same paragraph.

      **Important Rules:**
      - Do NOT partially praise the student unless it matches the option's meaning.  
      - Keep the explanation simple, student-friendly, detailed, and grammatically correct.
      - Use equations or symbols when needed.
      - Maintain a smooth flow between sentences.


   #### Output Constraint
    - Do NOT change the tone or structure.
    - Do NOT omit either:
        - the reason for rejecting a true/valid scientific statement, or
        - the reason for selecting a false/incorrect scientific statement.
    - This format is mandatory for all statement-based distractor analyses.

    **CRITICAL Distractor Analysis Requirements:**
    - **Maximum Length**: Each distractor rationale must be **4 lines maximum** (total for all three sub-sections combined)
    - **Child-Friendly Language**: Use simple, age-appropriate language suitable for {{Grade}}
    - **Concise and Clear**: No long explanations — keep it short and focused
    - **Educational Tone**: Supportive and corrective, not condescending
    - Do NOT say things like: “You correctly identified that…” for an incorrect option
    - Use scientific terms or labels when needed, but keep them minimal and grade-appropriate
    - Do NOT explicitly say phrases such as:
        • “Why students might select this”
        • “What’s wrong with this approach”
        • “Correct approach”
      (You directly explain the reasoning behind the distractor.)
    - Each distractor rationale must be unique and highlight a different type of misunderstanding
      (e.g., confusion about cause/effect, misclassification, wrong observation, misuse of terms, mixing processes, etc.)
    - Each distractor analysis must remain within the **4-line maximum**

      4. Environmental Science
          It focuses on how people interact with nature and their surroundings. It includes understanding geographical features, learning our responsibilities as community members, and studying the lives, cultures, and festivals of people in different regions.

      ALL FIB questions must remain strictly within the science domain implied by the Topic and Chapter.
      DO NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself explicitly integrates them.
      - Based on the domain selection you need to make questions 

    **Each FIB question must fall entirely within ONE science domain based on the Topic and Chapter.  
    Do NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself is inherently interdisciplinary.**

    === SCIENCE TAXONOMY RULE (MANDATORY) ===

      Each question MUST strictly follow the given Taxonomy. 
      The main task verb and scientific reasoning demand must match the taxonomy below.
      If a mismatch is found, STOP and return an error.

      Allowed Taxonomies (exact strings only):
      Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analysing, Evaluating

      1) Remembering (Science)
      - Purpose: Recall scientific facts or definitions
      - Allowed verbs: define, state, name, list, identify, label, recognise
      - Not allowed: explain, compare, justify, judge

      2) Understanding (Science)
      - Purpose: Show meaning of a scientific idea
      - Allowed verbs: explain (simple), describe, interpret (basic), classify
      - Not allowed: calculate, compare cases, justify claims

      3) Applying (Science)
      - Purpose: Use a learned scientific method or rule
      - Allowed verbs: use, apply, calculate (routine), solve, determine
      - Not allowed: evaluate claims, infer patterns

      4) Analysing (Science)
      - Purpose: Examine relationships in scientific information
      - Allowed verbs: compare, contrast, differentiate, infer (from given data), identify pattern, organize (data)
      - Not allowed: judge correctness, defend conclusions

      5) Evaluating (Science)
      - Purpose: Make scientific judgments using criteria or evidence
      - Allowed verbs: judge, decide, justify, evaluate, select best explanation
      - Not allowed: define, recall, simple explanation
      **
      VALIDATION RULE:
      - The question verb MUST belong to the allowed list of its taxonomy.
      - The solution MUST use the same cognitive level.
      - If Topic verb and Taxonomy conflict, return:
        "ERROR: Topic verb conflicts with declared Science Taxonomy. Revise 
      
    ## SINGLE TOPIC HANDLING (SAME TOPIC FOR MULTIPLE QUESTIONS):
      When multiple questions share the same topic number, analyze the PDF to understand the topic and infer its distinct subtopics.  
      For each existing question, identify its subtopic and core reasoning, and treat any new question as a duplicate if it repeats the same subtopic with the same logic, even if numbers or context change.  
      Generate new questions only from unused subtopics or by applying a clearly different reasoning pattern, and summarize covered subtopics to prevent repetition.
  ## TOPIC COVERAGE AND TRACEABILITY (MANDATORY)

  1. Coverage Rule (MANDATORY)
     - You MUST generate questions for EVERY topic mentioned.
     - Do NOT skip, merge, or partially cover any topic.
     - If a topic requires N questions, generate exactly N questions.

  2. Topic Traceability Rule
     - Above EACH question, explicitly mention:
       Topic Used: <exact topic name>
       FIB Type: <type used>
     - The topic name must exactly match one of the input topics.

  3. Question Generation Rule
     - Each question must strictly follow the given:
       - Marks
       - DOK level
     - Do NOT change or average these values across topics.
     - Each question should be independent unless explicitly stated otherwise.

   Continuity rule: When a question has multiple sub-parts (or when two or more items are grouped as a single set), all sub-parts must belong to one continuous scenario — the same storyline, characters and setting — and one sub-part should logically lead to the next. (Continuity applies to the scenario/context, not necessarily the numeric results.)

   Avoid producing items where the context appears scientific but the required reasoning is generic, recall-based, or superficial, as such items are considered weak in scientific topic alignment.
  4. Initial Planning Section (REQUIRED)
     Before generating questions, create a clear plan in this format:

     Planned Topics and Question Allocation:
     - Topic 1: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     - Topic 2: <topic name> → <number of questions>, <marks>, <DOK level>
     (Include ALL topics provided by the user.)

  5. Final Verification Section (REQUIRED)
     After generating all questions, add a final section titled:

     "Topic Coverage Verification"

     In this section:
     - List ALL topics provided by the user.
     - For each topic, explicitly state:
       - Number of questions generated
       - Confirmation that the requirement is fulfilled

     Example format:
     - Topic: ______ → Generated: __ / Required: __ → Status: COMPLETE

    ## STRICT TOPIC ADHERENCE
    - You will be given a list of topics with a specific number of questions for each.
    - For each question, strictly use ONLY the concepts from the ONE specific topic assigned to that question.
    - Do NOT mix concepts from different topics within a single question.
    - All parts of the question (Scenario, Sub-questions a, b, c, etc.) must belong to that SAME single topic.
    - Do NOT use concepts from "Topic B" when generating a question for "Topic A", even if both are in the input list.
    - Treat each topic's request as a completely isolated task.

    brrrrrrrrrr

      A Real-Life Images-Based FIB is a type of fill-in-the-blank question where the blank is based on a real-world image that is provided. The student needs to interpret the image to fill in the correct word or phrase.

    **Diagram Prompt:**

        A simple black-and-white line diagram showing two ponds labeled **Pond A** and **Pond B**.

        - **Pond A**:
          - Fish present in water
          - Fish feeding on insect larvae
          - Fewer insects around the pond
          - More flowering plants
          - Pollinators (bees/butterflies) visiting flowers

        - **Pond B**:
          - No fish in water
          - Many insect larvae
          - More insects around the pond
          - Fewer flowering plants
          - Less pollinator activity

        Use arrows to show:
        - Fish → insect larvae
        - Pollinators → flowers

        The diagram should be simple, exam-oriented, and suitable for school-level ecology questions.

    **Question:**  
      Riya was conducting an experiment in her school garden to observe how the presence of one organism affects others. Based on this scenario and the picture given, complete the blanks.

      She noticed that in Pond A, the |TEXT 1| around the pond was significantly higher compared to Pond B.
      This led Riya to conclude that the presence of |TEXT 2| might be an influencing factor.
      In Pond A, the larvae of |TEXT 3| are eaten, which are natural predators of |TEXT 4|.
      As a result, there was more pollination of nearby plants, leading to the production of more seeds.

    ### 3. Fill in the Blank (IMAGE BASED)

    **Description:**  
      An Image-Based FIB is a type of fill-in-the-blank question where the blank is related to an image, diagram, or illustration, and the student must identify or describe something based on the visual provided.      No image is provided.  

    **Examples:**

    ### IMAGE BASED FIB

      An Image-Based FIB is a type of fill-in-the-blank question where the blank is related to an image, diagram, or illustration, and the student must identify or describe something based on the visual provided.

      Analyze the given picture and complete the blanks.

      The first trophic level consists of |TEXT 1|.
      The next trophic level consists of |TEXT 2|.
      These are followed by |TEXT 3|.
      At the top of the food pyramid are the |TEXT 4|.

      If the mouse disappears, it would affect the |TEXT 5| more and their number will |TEXT 6|.

      The number of organisms in the |TEXT 7| trophic level is always higher compared to higher levels, due to the decrease in energy at each level.

      ---

      ### Diagram Prompt

      A simple black-and-white food web diagram showing:
      - Grass at the base
      - Mouse, rabbit, and grasshopper feeding on grass
      - Lizard and snake feeding on herbivores
      - Hawk at the top as the apex predator

      Use arrows to show the direction of energy flow.  
      Label each organism clearly.  
      The diagram should be simple, exam-oriented, and suitable for middle school ecology questions.

    ### 4. Fill in the Blank (Image-Based Science Observation)

    **Description:**  
      An Image-Based FIB is a type of fill-in-the-blank question where the blank is related to an image, diagram, or illustration, and the student must identify or describe something based on the visual provided.
    **Example (with Diagram Prompt):**

    **Diagram Prompt:**  
      Show two identical plants kept in sunlight.  
      One plant is covered with a transparent bell jar containing potassium hydroxide; the other is uncovered.

    **Question:**  
      The plant covered with potassium hydroxide does not show starch formation because **|TEXT1|** is absent.  
      This proves that **|TEXT2|** is necessary for photosynthesis.

    ---

    ### 5. Fill in the Blank (Data-Based – Science)

    **Description:**  
      A Data-Based FIB is a type of fill-in-the-blank question where students are given a set of data (e.g., a table, graph, or chart), and they need to fill in the blank by interpreting or analyzing the data.

    **Example:**

    | Substance | Melting Point (°C) |
    |---------|------------------|
    | Ice     | 0                |
    | Iron   | 1538             |
    | Wax    | 62               |

    **Question:**  
    Among the substances given, **|TEXT1|** has the lowest melting point.  
    At room temperature, **|TEXT2|** is most likely to remain solid.

    ---

    ### 6. Fill in the Blank (Numerical and Image Based – Science)

    **Description:**  
      A Numerical and Image Combined Fill-in-the-Blanks (FIB) is a type of question where the student is provided with both an image and a numerical context. The student must use the visual representation to help interpret or solve the problem, and then fill in the blank with the correct numerical value based on their analysis of the image and understanding of the concept. 

    **Examples:**
     ### Diagram Prompt

      A clear, labeled diagram showing **three vertical thermometers** placed side by side:
      - Thermometer 1 labeled **Celsius (°C)**
      - Thermometer 2 labeled **Kelvin (K)**
      - Thermometer 3 labeled **Fahrenheit (°F)**

      The diagram should mark:
      - **Boiling point of water** with a horizontal red line across all three thermometers  
        - 100°C, 373 K, 212°F  
      - **Freezing point of water** with a horizontal blue line across all three thermometers  
        - 0°C, 273 K, 32°F  

      Each temperature value should be clearly written next to the corresponding scale.  
      The diagram should be simple, neat, and suitable for school-level science examinations.


            
      Analyze the given diagram showing three temperature scales and complete the blanks.

      Compare the temperature on three different temperature scales.

      1. Water boils at __________ [TEXT 1] °C which is equivalent to __________ [TEXT 2] °F.  
      2. Water freezes at __________ [TEXT 3] °C which is equivalent to __________ [TEXT 4] K.

    ---

    ### 7. Fill in the Blank (Equation-Based – Science)

    **Description:**  
        An equation-based FIB (Fill in the Blank) presents a mathematical, scientific, or chemical equation with one or more missing components (such as coefficients, variables, or chemical formulas). The student is required to fill in the blanks with the correct values or terms that make the equation accurate and complete. This type of question tests the student’s understanding of the underlying principles behind the equation and their ability to apply them in different contexts. Additionally, equation-based FIBs may also ask for definitions, terms, or classifications related to the equation, such as identifying the type of reaction or process being described. 

    **Examples:**

    -Complete the equation for photosynthesis:

      __ CO₂ + __ H₂O + light energy → __ C₆H₁₂O₆ + __ O₂

      This process occurs in the __________ of plant cells, where sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.



    ---

    ### Validation Check (Mandatory)

    **“Does the scientific concept become unavoidable because of the situation, data, diagram, or equation?”**  
    If **NO** → the FIB is weak or artificial → rewrite or reject.


  ## FIB Type Selection Rule (CRITICAL)
   - In the TOPICS_SECTION, each question may optionally specify an "FIB Type".
   - If "FIB Type" is specified, you **MUST STRICTLY** generate a question that fits that specific definition and style.
   - If "FIB Type" is "Auto" or NOT specified, you must choose the most appropriate type based on the topic and grade level, ensuring variety across the set.

  For each question, you must specify:
    - **FIB Type**: (Concept (definition)/REAL LIFE IMAGES BASED /IMAGE BASED /Image-Based Science Observation/ Data Based /Numerical and Image Based/ Equation Based)
      - **Mark of question**: {{Marks}}
      - **DOK level of question**: {{DOK_Level}}
      - **Taxonomy of question**: {{Taxonomy}}
    
    {{FIB_SUBPART_SPECS}}
    
    **CRITICAL - SUBPART STRUCTURE (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)**:
    
    ⚠️ **STEP 1: CHECK THE CONFIGURATION ABOVE** ⚠️
    Look at the "FIB Sub-parts Configuration" section immediately above this instruction.
    - If it shows "Question X: N sub-parts - i) DOK..., ii) DOK...", that question REQUIRES roman numeral subparts
    - If a question is NOT listed in the configuration, it should be a single-part question (no subparts)
    
    ⚠️ **STEP 2: FOR QUESTIONS WITH SUB-PARTS LISTED** ⚠️
    You MUST follow this structure EXACTLY:
    
    1. **Roman Numeral Labels (MANDATORY)**:
       - Use i), ii), iii), iv), v) for each subpart
       - DO NOT use a), b), c) or 1), 2), 3)
       - DO NOT create a single question without subparts when subparts are specified
    
    2. **Subpart Requirements**:
       - Each subpart (i, ii, iii, etc.) must have its own blank(s)
       - Each subpart must match its specified DOK, Marks, and Taxonomy from the configuration
       - All subparts belong to ONE continuous scenario/context
       - Each subpart tests a different aspect of the same concept
    
    3. **Marker Numbering (CRITICAL)**:
       - Number markers sequentially across ALL subparts: |TEXT 1|, |TEXT 2|, |TEXT 3|, etc.
       - Example: If subpart i) uses |TEXT 1|, then subpart ii) starts with |TEXT 2|
       - DO NOT restart numbering for each subpart
    
    
    Instructions for generating questions:
    - Names should be simple and commonly used  (eg : Jack	Anna  Ryan	Emily	Sam	Maria	John	)
    
        DO NOT use academic or classroom settings.
        This means NO:
        - teacher, student, class, quiz, test, homework, assignment, exam, studying
  - THE QUESTION SHOULD BE STRICTLY FRON THE TOPIC AND SHOULD USE ALL ITS CORRECT SUB TOPIC FOR EACH QUESTIONS 
    1. UNIQUE FIB QUESTION DESIGN — CORE UNIQUENESS RULES

      1. One Concept, Many Reasoning Paths
        - Stay strictly within the given topic or sub-concept.
        - Do NOT introduce additional formulas, identities, or side-topics.
        - Uniqueness must come from how the concept is used, not from adding new concepts.

      2. Reasoning-Path Uniqueness (Most Important Rule)
        - No two questions (across FIB items) may follow the same logical reasoning flow.
        - Changing only numbers, names, or objects does NOT count as uniqueness.
        - Each question must require a different cognitive journey.

        Examples of distinct reasoning paths:
          • Direct computation vs reverse inference
          • Finding a value vs identifying position/index
          • Comparing distant terms vs predicting future value
          • Inferring missing parameters vs applying known ones
          • Planning/optimization vs exact calculation
          • Constraint satisfaction vs free computation

      3. Same Formula ≠ Same Question
        - Even if the same formula is used, the *entry point* must differ.
        - Students should not be able to solve two questions by repeating the same steps in the same order.
        - If the steps feel copy-paste with changed values, the question is invalid.

     
      4. Cognitive Twist Requirement
        - Every question must contain a “twist” that forces thinking beyond routine substitution.
        - Twists may include:
            • Hidden or indirect data
            • Relational differences instead of absolute values
            • Constraints that conflict (limited resources, exact target, minimum/maximum condition)
            • Multi-step dependency (one result feeds another)

      5. DOK 3 Exclusivity Rules (Science)

        DOK 3 science questions are **NOT restricted to calculations** and must **NOT** be solvable by:
        - Simple recall of facts or definitions
        - Applying a single formula or rule
        - One-step arithmetic or direct substitution
        - Mechanical procedures with a fixed method

        They **must require strategic scientific reasoning**, which may be **quantitative or non-quantitative**, such as:
        - Planning an investigation or selecting variables
        - Interpreting data, graphs, or experimental results
        - Testing, revising, or justifying a scientific explanation
        - Analyzing cause–effect relationships
        - Evaluating constraints, trade-offs, or competing explanations

        ---

      6. Logical-Operation Sequence Diversity (Science)

        Each DOK 3 question must use a **distinct internal reasoning sequence**.  
        Do **not** reuse the same logical pathway across questions.

        Avoid repeating patterns like:
        - Recall → Apply → Answer
        - Substitute → Calculate → State

        Examples of valid and diverse science reasoning sequences:
        - Observe evidence → Infer mechanism → Predict outcome
        - Compare models → Identify limitation → Conclude
        - Analyze variables → Test hypothesis → Revise explanation
        - Evaluate data → Detect anomaly → Justify claim
        - Relate concepts → Explain interaction → Validate conclusion

        ---

      7. No Structural Reuse (Science)

        Avoid repeating the same question skeleton, such as:
        - “Given X and Y, find Z”
        - “Calculate the value of …”

        Instead, vary the **task type**, including:
        - Prediction under altered scientific conditions
        - Reconstruction of a process from partial evidence
        - Comparison of two systems or experiments
        - Optimization of a scientific method or design
        - Validation or refutation of a claim using evidence


      8. Backtracking & Indirect Inference Encouraged
          - Prefer questions where:
              • The student must work backwards
              • Key parameters are not directly given
              • Relationships must be decoded before calculation

      11. Anti-Pattern Checklist (If YES → Reject Question)
          - Can this be solved in one step?
          - Does it mirror another question’s solution flow?
          - Is the only difference numerical?
          - Does it rely on rote substitution?
          - Would an average student solve it mechanically (for DOK 3)?
      
    2. Explanation of DOK Levels:
       ### SKILL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
  
        - Based on the Dok level mentioned for each question you need to refer the below table to make sure the question is of the correct DOK level.

        | TIMSS Science Skill                                   | DOK 1 (1 Mark)                                                   | DOK 2 (1 Mark)                                                             | DOK 3 (2 Marks)                                                                                          |
        |--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | **1. Formulating Questions & Hypotheses**             | State a simple question about the scenario/source.               | —                                                                          | Formulate a testable hypothesis OR pose a complex scientific question based on the case.                  |
        | **2. Designing & Conducting Investigations**          | —                                                                | Identify one key variable, material, or condition for an investigation.    | Propose a full experimental plan (variables, controls, procedure) to test a concept from the scenario.     |
        | **3. Working with Data**                              | Extract/read one piece of data from the case.                   | Identify a pattern, trend, or relationship from the data.                  | —                                                                                                         |
        | **4. Interpreting & Drawing Conclusions**             | —                                                                | Make an inference or simple explanation linking evidence to a principle.   | —                                                                                                         |
        | **5. Evaluating Scientific Explanations**             | —                                                                | —                                                                          | Critique or justify a claim/conclusion using evidence and scientific reasoning.                           |
        | **6. Communicating Scientific Ideas**                 | Define, name, or state a key term/concept using correct science terminology. | —                                                              | —                                                                                                         |

    3. FILL IN THE BLANKS (FIB) — QUESTION DESIGN RULES

        Fill in the Blanks questions are used to assess mathematical understanding where
        students must supply missing information directly, without being guided step-by-step.
        FIB questions may include 2 distinct answer-handling types:

        ────────────────────────────────────────
        1. UNIQUE-ANSWER FIB (TEXT ENTRY)
        ────────────────────────────────────────

        • Use when:
          - Only ONE scientific correct answer exists.
          - Use for ALL scientific questions.
          - Allow ONLY ONE correct answer.
          - No alternative wording or representation is acceptable.

        • Format:
          - Use |TEXT n| placeholders.
          - No dropdowns, no options shown to students.

        • Answer Key Rules:
          - Provide exactly one correct value.
          - Do NOT add unnecessary variants.

        • Typical use cases:
          - Exact values,
          - Final inferred results,
          - Constrained outcomes after reasoning.

        • Example (validated):
          TEXT1: 196
          TEXT2: 225
          TEXT3: 14

        ────────────────────────────────────────
        2. PROBABLE-ANSWER FIB (TEXT ENTRY)
        ────────────────────────────────────────

        • Use when:
          - The correct answer can be written in multiple valid ways.
          - Use when the SAME correct answer can be written in MULTIPLE valid ways
            (word form, number form, equivalent expressions, accepted terminology).

        • Format:
          - Use placeholders: |TEXT 1|, |TEXT 2|, etc.
          - Do NOT provide options inside the question.
          - Student response is free text.

        • Answer Key Rules:
          - All scientific acceptable answers must be listed.
          - Separate probable answers using a semicolon (;).
          - Do NOT include unnecessary variations.
          - Only scientifically and linguistically valid equivalents are allowed.

        • Example (validated):
          |TEXT 1| → single; one; 1

        • Important:
          - The blank must NOT reduce to a single forced representation.
          - If only one exact response is possible, this is NOT a probable-answer FIB.
       
  ** Based on the topic, grade level, and concepts being assessed, you may choose the most appropriate Fill in the Blanks type (unique-answer, probable-answer, ); a single topic may include a mix of all three types, and where visual understanding is required, you may include a diagram prompt describing the image to be shown (for visualization purposes only), ensuring the diagram contains only essential visual information and does not include labels, values, or clues that directly reveal the answer.
      EXAMPLE 1: UNIQUE ANSWER (Scientific – only one correct answer)

      Question:
      Calculate the number of protons in a carbon atom if its atomic number is 6.
      Number of protons = |TEXT1|

      Answer:
      TEXT1: 6

      ------------------------------------------------------------

      EXAMPLE 2: PROBABLE / MULTIPLE ANSWERS (Scientific – more than one valid form)

      Question:
      Name the process by which green plants make their own food.
      |TEXT1|

      Answers:
      TEXT1: photosynthesis; Photosynthesis

      ------------------------------------------------------------

    3.  Marks and Blanks Rules (STRICT RULE):

    - Wherever possible, prioritize using blanks with **0.5 marks** (e.g., split a 1-mark question into two 0.5-mark blanks).

    - For a **1-mark question**:
      - Use **one blank of 1 mark**, OR
      - Use **two blanks of 0.5 mark each**.

    - For a **2-mark question**:
      - Use **at least two blanks** (any valid combination of 0.5 or 1 mark each).

    - For a **3-mark question**:
      - Use **at least three blanks** (any valid combination of 0.5 or 1 mark each).

    - It is allowed to include **multiple blanks** as appropriate to the question type, provided the above marking rules are satisfied.
    - Each blank should carry marks in proportion to its allotted value.
    - Wherever 0.5 mark is possible, it should be used.

  4. Diagram Prompt (for visualization purposes only) 
    ## DIAGRAM RULES
        - Diagram is optional (unless the topic inherently requires visual representation).
        - If included, give a **diagram prompt** (NOT the actual image).
        - If the topic inherently requires visual representation, then the diagram is mandatory.And the questions in the topic should be image based and everything should be related to the image .
        
        ### Diagram Prompt Guidelines:
        
        **Purpose**: Create exam-ready visual representations that support the question.
        
        **Content Requirements**:
          - It should describe the scene (NOT just "make 2 shapes with these lengths")
          - Must be an image suitable for putting in an exam paper
          - Should contain the scene with marking of values if needed
          - Create a realistic, data-based diagram that directly represents the situation
          - Visually match the setup (e.g., areas, objects, sections, or people mentioned) using relevant numerical values
          - Include only essential measurable details — such as quantities, time, cost, length, or rates — with proper units
          - Keep it simple, consistent, and self-contained
          - The diagram must reflect the same context as the question but present it through clear numbers or labeled visuals
        
        **Format Requirements**:
          - Do NOT give point-by-point descriptions
          - Use continuous narrative that properly defines everything
          - Write as a cohesive description, not a bulleted list
        
        ### Numerical Placement Rules:
          - **Diagram Prompt**: Introduce actual values, quantities, or relationships

        
        ### No-Repetition Rule:
          - Details or data mentioned in the context must NOT be repeated in the diagram
          - Each section must serve a distinct purpose:
              • Short Context = Real-life setup and qualitative description
              • Diagram = Visual/numerical representation of the setup
  5. ## INSTRUCTION OVERVIEW:
    - IMPORTANT → Total Questions to Generate: {{TOTAL_QUESTIONS}} (Sum of all questions across topics)
    - You can add multiple blanks in a question 
    - A single Fill in the Blanks question may contain one or more blanks (|TEXT|), where each blank independently tests a specific part of the concept or reasoning step.
    - Based on the topic you need to generate questions
    - For the specified Topic(s), identify relevant parts of concepts and ensure that each question uses these sub-concepts in context.
    - Use the supplied **Grade** and **Concepts** to determine the appropriate cognitive depth and difficulty for each part.
    - Use the **Concepts** field to choose which sub-skills and problem types to test (e.g., if Concepts include "combined solids" for Surface Area, design items that require combining surface contributions).
    - questions must be **age-appropriate, realistic, and directly tied to the chapter/topic**.
    - Age-appropriate wording and language must be used in the questions.
    - Difficulty should come from problem-solving, NOT from vocabulary.
    - Fill in the Blanks questions must be computation- or reasoning-based; do not use “Define”, “State”, “Explain”, “Describe”, “Why”, or “Prove that”, and do not create yes/no type questions. Blanks must represent calculated or logically inferred results, not memorized definitions.

    - The solution for all questions must follow the **specific strategy or method** explicitly mentioned under *Concepts* for that chapter.  
      - If the chapter introduces or emphasizes a particular technique, then **every relevant calculation in that chapter** must use the same technique, even in simpler sub-questions (both question and solution).  
      - This ensures consistency with what the student is currently being taught at that grade level.  
      - Only if no specific method is mentioned in the concepts should the general grade-appropriate method be used.
  
  
  6. ## TEXTBOOK CONTENT HANDLING (CRITICAL)
    - **Do NOT treat the textbook/concept excerpts as reading passages in questions**
    - **Do NOT reference the textbook/concept material as a passage**
    - Questions must be self-contained and NEVER reference the source material directly
    All generated questions and solutions must be fully standalone and must NOT reference textbook pages, chapters, passages, or excerpts. Do NOT treat the textbook content as a passage to be quoted or cited.

    **FORBIDDEN question/Answer patterns:**
    - ❌ "According to the textbook..."
    - ❌ "According to the definition provided in the chapter..."
    - ❌ "The story on page 13 mentions..."
    - ❌ "The definition on page X specifically states..."
    - ❌ "Based on the passage/story/definition provided..."
    - ❌ "As described in the concept/chapter..."
    
    **Correct approach:**
    - ✅ Extract the mathematical concept and create an independent question
    - ✅ Questions should stand alone without referencing the source
    - ✅ Use the concepts to generate original problem scenarios
    - ✅ Never make students refer back to textbook pages or definitions
    
    - Do NOT convert textbook/concept text into long descriptive paragraphs in your questions as well as answers .
    - Use only the necessary elements from the content to construct the question.
    - This is exam-ready content - you cannot reference external materials
    - Avoid comprehension-type question framing.

  ## Representation and Operation Discipline
    All generated questions, options, solutions, reasoning steps must strictly conform to the representations, terminology, units, symbols, operations, methods, and concepts that appear in the provided textbook/PDF for that topic and grade.

    Rules:
    1. Do not introduce any terminology, unit, operation, theorem, transformation, or representation that is not present in the textbook/PDF.
    2. If the textbook uses specific representations (e.g., turns instead of degrees for rotational symmetry), you must use the same representation consistently.
    3. If the textbook omits a representation or concept (e.g., order of rotational symmetry, angle measures, orientation mapping, matrices, coordinate geometry), do not introduce it.
    4. Do not upgrade the abstraction level (e.g., do not convert fractions of turns into degrees or other advanced forms).unless in textbook its there 
    5. Do not use any problem-solving technique, domain language, or reasoning step that students at this grade have not been taught based on the textbook/PDF.
    6. During validation, flag and repair any violation of these rules automatically without altering the structural format of the question type.
    7. Textbook/PDF takes priority over general NCERT content. Only use NCERT-level knowledge if it naturally aligns and does not introduce new constructs.
    8. If a representation or construct is missing in the textbook/PDF, treat it as prohibited.

    Enforcement:
    - These rules apply to the question, solution and key idea.
    - Any violation must be corrected before final output.
      - Even when content is limited to a single topic, you MUST generate variety through:
          • different numerical setups
          • different problem contexts
          • different reasoning approaches
          • different applications of the same concept
      - Questions should test mathematical understanding, not reading comprehension of textbook material.
      - The solution for all questions  must follow the **specific strategy or method** explicitly mentioned under *Concepts* for that chapter (for example, box method, lattice method, partial quotient, repeated addition, etc.).  
      - If the chapter introduces or emphasizes a particular technique (e.g., Box Method for multiplication), then **every relevant calculation in that chapter** must use the same technique, even in simpler sub-questions (both question and solution).  
      - The solution must be grade level appropriate and should containe detailed explanation of the solution.
      - This ensures consistency with what the student is currently being taught at that grade level.  
      - Only if no specific method is mentioned in the concepts should the general grade-appropriate method be used.
      - **Do not** use or refer to physics, chemistry, biology, or other science formulas (e.g., density, force, pressure, velocity).
      - All sub-questions must be completely based on the scenario only(Dont give question outside the scenario), not on outside knowledge or assumptions. 
  ## TAXONOMY LOCK RULE (MANDATORY)

  **Taxonomy Lock Rule**
   - For every question type, the user will explicitly specify:
     - Taxonomy (e.g., Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, etc.)
     - DOK level
     - Marks
   - You MUST use **only the taxonomy provided for that question type**.
   - Do NOT substitute, infer, upgrade, downgrade, or mix taxonomies.
   - If a question cannot be generated under the given taxonomy, you must still stay within it and simplify the question accordingly.

  **One-to-One Mapping**
    - Each generated question must map **directly** to:
      - The taxonomy mentioned for that specific question type
      - The DOK level mentioned for that specific question type
    - Do not reuse taxonomy from other question types.

  **Output Consistency Check (Mandatory)**
      - Before finalizing output, internally verify:
        - Taxonomy in the output exactly matches the taxonomy stated in the input for that question.
        - No question contains cognitive operations beyond the allowed taxonomy.
          - Example:
            - "Analyze", "justify", "compare", "prove" → NOT allowed in Remembering
            - "Recall", "state", "identify" → NOT sufficient for Analyzing
      - If mismatch is detected, regenerate the question.

  **Explicit Display Rule**
      - Above each question, clearly display(the question and the this part should be seperated with a line (DONT ADD FOR SUBQUESTIONS, IT SHOULD BE ABOVE EACH QUESTION ) ):
        - Topic
        - Marks
        - DOK Level
        - Taxonomy (must match input verbatim)

  **No Cross-Contamination**
      - Do NOT let:
        - Higher-order taxonomy leak into lower-order questions
        - Solution explanations exceed the allowed cognitive level

  **Failure Handling**
      - If user input is ambiguous or internally inconsistent:
        - State the limitation clearly
        - Do NOT guess or auto-correct taxonomy

  **Final Validation Statement**
      - After generating all questions, include a final checklist stating:
        - Which taxonomies were requested
        - Which taxonomies were used
        - Confirm they match exactly
  OUTPUT FORMAT — FILL IN THE BLANKS (FIB)

    Generate Fill in the Blanks questions strictly in the following format.

    SEPARATE EACH QUESTION ITEM WITH THE DELIMITER: `|||QUESTION_START|||` (only at the start of the question)

    Each question must include:

    1. Question Statement:
      - Present a clear mathematical statement with one or more blanks.
      - Use the placeholders exactly as:
          |TEXT 1|, |TEXT 2|, |TEXT 3|, … for text-entry blanks
      - Do NOT provide hints, methods, or formulas in the question text.
      - A single question may contain multiple blanks.

    2. Diagram Prompt (Optional):
      - If visualisation is required, include a separate diagram prompt.
      - Describe the image to be shown (do NOT include the actual image).
      - The diagram must:
          • support understanding only,
          • contain no labels, values, or clues that reveal the answer,
          • include only essential visual elements needed for interpretation.

    3. Answer Key:
      - Clearly map each blank to its answer.
      - For UNIQUE-ANSWER blanks:
          TEXT n: exact single correct answer
      - For PROBABLE-ANSWER blanks:
          TEXT n: list all acceptable answers separated by semicolons (;)

    4. Solution Explanation:
      - Provide a clear, step-by-step explanation.
      - Use age-appropriate mathematical reasoning .
      - using technique that the student studied in the chapter.
      - Justify the filled answers implicitly through reasoning.
      - Do NOT reference answer placeholders in the explanation.

    ## STRICT KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARY RULES
    Treat the uploaded PDFs/images as the only source of knowledge. Do not use any outside syllabus, curriculum, or textbook knowledge. Do not introduce concepts, terminology, skills, or grade-level content that is not explicitly shown in the uploaded material. If the material shows addition, subtraction, even/odd numbers, halving, or true/false reasoning, generate new items only using those same concepts. Do not name properties, laws, or theories unless they are explicitly printed in the PDF/image.

    Generate new/duplicate questions that match the original item structure, same difficulty level, and same style. Do not increase the grade level or add any new concepts. Do not assume hidden mathematical knowledge. Do not infer properties (example: do not mention commutativity unless the PDF/image names it). Do not introduce higher grade concepts.

    The uploaded content defines a closed knowledge boundary. If a concept, method, property, term, or instruction is not present in the PDF/image, do not include it in the generated items. Stay fully faithful to the language, style, tasks, operations, and reasoning patterns present in the PDF/image.

    FORMAT EXAMPLE (STRUCTURE ONLY):

    Question:
    <question text with |TEXT| >

    Diagram Prompt (if required):
    <description of the visual to be shown>

    Answer Key (with mark distribution):
    TEXT 1: mark distribution
    TEXT 2: mark distribution

    Solution Explanation:
    <step-by-step reasoning> 

    6. KEY IDEA (MANDATORY – EDUCATIONAL, STRICT FORMAT)

      You must write a KEY IDEA meant for a weak or struggling student.

      ASSUME:
      - The student has NEVER seen this topic before.
      - The student does NOT know any technical or mathematical terminology.

      HARD RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
      - Do NOT mention any numbers, symbols, variables, equations, diagrams, or values from the question.
      - Do NOT use advanced or textbook-style language.
      - Do NOT write in a single flowing paragraph.
      - Do NOT skip or merge sections.
      - The explanation must work for ANY similar question of this type.

      LANGUAGE RULES:
      - Use very simple, school-level English.
      - Prefer short sentences.
      - If a word sounds technical, explain it immediately or avoid it.
      - Write as if you are teaching a confused student one-on-one.

      --------------------------------------------------

      REQUIRED STRUCTURE (WRITE EXACTLY IN THIS ORDER):

      KEY IDEA

      1. What kind of problems these are  
      Explain in simple words what these questions are generally asking the student to understand or find.

      2. Core idea behind these problems  
      Explain the main idea from the beginning, as if the student has zero background knowledge.

      3. Why this idea works  
      Explain logically why this method makes sense in real understanding, not just as a rule to memorize.
 
      4. General step-by-step method  
      Write this as clearly numbered steps:
      Step 1:  
      Step 2:  
      Step 3:  
      Step 4:  

      Each step must describe ONE clear action the student should take.

      5. Common mistakes students make  
      Mention at least two common mistakes and explain why students make them.

      6. Tips to avoid these mistakes  
      Give simple, practical tips written directly for a student.
      **- Do NOT explicitly break the explanation into “What kind of problems”, “Core idea”,"Common mistakes students make  " or “Why this works”.
      Do NOT restate or refer to the given question (Why this idea works .. etc ). **
      --------------------------------------------------

      QUALITY CHECK (MANDATORY):
      - Minimum length: 6–8 full sentences.
      - The explanation must be reusable for any similar problem.
      - If the explanation sounds suitable for a strong student, rewrite it to be simpler.

    - Do not mix answer types within a single blank.
    - Do not include unnecessary variations in probable answers.
    - Ensure every blank tests understanding, not guessing.
    - Output language must be English.

  ## OUTPUT FORMAT RULE (SCIENCE)

    • Use ONLY plain Markdown text.  
    • Do NOT use LaTeX or TeX in any form.

    ### Rules:
    • Write scientific expressions in clear plain text.  
    • Use standard symbols and Unicode superscripts/subscripts (e.g., m/s², H₂O, Na⁺).  
    • Write divisions inline using / (e.g., distance/time).  
    • Write chemical equations in one line using → or ⇌.  
    • Always write units explicitly.

    ### Forbidden:
    • No $, $$, \( \), or any LaTeX notation.  
    • No backslash commands or math environments.

    ### Examples:
    ✔ Speed = distance/time = 10 m / 2 s = 5 m/s  
    ✔ 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O  
    ✘ $\frac{a}{b}$ , \ce{H2O}
