  ## SCIENCE DOMAIN REFERENCE (MANDATORY SECTION)
    1. Life Science
        Life Science deals with the study of living organisms—plants, animals, humans, and microorganisms.
        It explains how they grow, reproduce, adapt, and interact with each other and their environment.
        
    2. Physical Science
        Physical Science focuses on non-living systems.
        It includes the study of matter, energy, force, motion, heat, light, sound, electricity, and magnetism.
        It is about how the physical world works.
    3. Earth Science
        Earth Science is the study of the Earth and its processes.
        It includes topics like rocks, soil, water, atmosphere, weather, climate, and natural disasters.
        It is about how the Earth changes and supports life.
        
    4. Environmental Science
        It focuses on how people interact with nature and their surroundings. It includes understanding geographical features, learning our responsibilities as community members, and studying the lives, cultures, and festivals of people in different regions.

    ALL CBS questions must remain strictly within the science domain implied by the Topic and Chapter.
    DO NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself explicitly integrates them.

  **Each CBS question must fall entirely within ONE science domain based on the Topic and Chapter.  
  Do NOT mix domains unless the Topic itself is inherently interdisciplinary.**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CASE-BASED SCENARIO RULES (STRICT)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each CBS question MUST start with a **single continuous Scenario paragraph**.

  Scenario Requirements:
    1. Scenario First:
        - The question must begin with a cohesive real-life scenario.
        - It must be written as a flowing paragraph — NOT bullet points.

    2. Purpose of Scenario:
        - Introduce who is involved, what is happening, and why it matters.
        - Should feel natural, realistic, and age-appropriate.

    3. No Numerical Values in Scenario:
        - NO numbers, measurements, data, or exact quantities inside the scenario.
        - The scenario must be entirely qualitative:
            “some plants,” “a certain amount of heat,”
            “a group of students,” “different materials,” etc.

    4. No Scenario Repetition:
        - Do not repeat scenario facts in the sub-questions.

    5. Scenario Realism:
        - Must fit real Indian contexts (Names, places, etc.)
        - Minimum four lines.
        - Must be scientifically plausible (no fictional or impossible science).

    6. Abstract Topics:
        - For conceptual topics (e.g., photosynthesis, circuits, separation of substances),
          embed them in relatable contexts (e.g., gardening, classroom experiments,
          household observations).

    7. Variety:
        - Each scenario across questions must be UNIQUE — do not repeat settings.

    8. Scenario Application:
        - Scenario must directly relate to the topic and demonstrate the concept
          in a real-life context.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  VARIATION ACROSS QUESTIONS
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Do NOT repeat reasoning paths, scenario types, or question structures.
    - Each CBS question must follow a different cognitive route.
    - Avoid trivial variations like changing context or nouns.
    - Avoid repeated operations such as:
      “identify → explain → evaluate” in every question.
  Each CBS must feel uniquely structured.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INSTRUCTION OVERVIEW
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Questions must strictly reflect the Topic/Chapter.
    - If multiple topics are listed, integrate all topics inside the CBS
      (across parts a, b, c).
    - Do NOT mix unrelated concepts.
    - New concepts in the Topic take priority.
    - Old concepts can support reasoning but cannot form full questions.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  OUTPUT FORMAT
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For each CBS question, output:

      1. Chosen Skill Set:
          - State Option 1/2/3 clearly.

      2. CBS Material:
          - Real-life scenario paragraph (qualitative, 4+ lines)

      3. Item Questions:
          - (a) DOK 1
          - (b) DOK 2
          - (c) DOK 3
          - All must arise from the scenario ONLY.

      4. Answer Key:
          - Step-by-step reasoning.
          - Value-point marking.
          - For DOK 3 → include a line:
              “Logical-operation sequence (DOK 3): [___ → ___ → ___].”

    Output must be in English.
    Ensure ALL questions require genuine scientific reasoning.
