## BATCH SUMMARY (MANDATORY)

After generating all questions in the current batch, produce a single
batch_summary that lists each question's core mathematical idea individually.

Additionally, for EVERY question, you MUST explicitly identify and record
the scenario used to frame the question.

────────────────────────
DUPLICATE PREVENTION RULE (MATHEMATICAL IDEA):
1. Before generating each question, you MUST check the "Existing Knowledge Base" (if provided).
2. If a mathematical idea or solution pattern already exists, you MUST change the logic,
   reasoning direction, or mathematical structure.
3. Changing names, numbers, or surface story wording is NOT sufficient.

────────────────────────
NORMALIZATION RULE:
4. Before checking for duplicates, normalize each question to its abstract mathematical form
   (operation + structure). Ignore story context and objects.

5. Questions using the same operation with the same fixed structure
   (e.g., division by 100) are considered duplicates unless they require
   fundamentally different reasoning.

6. A question is considered distinct ONLY if it introduces at least one of:
   - a different mathematical operation
   - a different direction of reasoning
   - a different representational domain
   - a different constraint or logical structure

────────────────────────
SCENARIO UNIQUENESS RULE (CRITICAL):
7. Every question MUST use a clearly identifiable scenario
   (e.g., money, distance, time, classroom, transport, sports, cooking, measurements).

8. NO TWO QUESTIONS may use the SAME scenario.
   Scenario repetition of any kind is STRICTLY PROHIBITED.

9. Before generating a question, you MUST verify that:
   - its mathematical idea is not duplicated, AND
   - its scenario has not appeared earlier in the batch or in prior batches (if provided).

10. If a new mathematical idea exists but no unused scenario is available,
    DO NOT generate the question and explicitly state:
    "No valid new question possible due to scenario exhaustion."

────────────────────────
CRITICAL RULE: ONE ENTRY PER QUESTION
1. Provide exactly one entry per generated question.
2. DO NOT merge or generalize entries.
3. If N questions are generated:
   - batch_summary MUST have N comma-separated entries
   - scenario_used MUST have N comma-separated entries
   - Order MUST match question order exactly

────────────────────────
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):

```json
{
  "batch_summary": "Append new mathematical concepts to Existing Knowledge Base here (comma-separated)",
  "scenario_used": "Unique scenario per question, no repetition (comma-separated)"
}
```

Example (for 3 questions):
Q1. Which gas is released during photosynthesis?
Q2. A plant kept in sunlight produces bubbles in water. What do these bubbles indicate?
Q3. Why are green plants called producers?

{
  "batch_summary": "1. gas released during photosynthesis, 2. oxygen release observed during photosynthesis in sunlight, 3. food production by green plants through photosynthesis",
  "scenario_used": "theoretical biology concept, laboratory observation in water setup, ecological role of plants in food chain"
}



Rules:
1. **Concatenate**: Take the "Existing Knowledge Base" values and append your new values (comma-separated).
2. Ensure the list grows with each batch by exactly the number of questions generated.
